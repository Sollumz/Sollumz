# 📑 Setting up the model and materials

### Importing a model

Without further ado, import a model (from a different game, modelled by yourself) to Blender. In this case, I am going to import the Super GT from GTAIV in `.FBX` format.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can ditch that part if your vehicle was modelled in Blender.
{% endhint %}

As the import has finished, you will see an imported mesh.

### Assigning materials

The subject of consideration for this tutorial is the bonnet part. To assign a material, go to Material tab, click on Browse material button and select the material from the list. In this case, I have assigned a vehicle paint one to the outer part of the bonnet.

The same is true for all the bonnet's materials.
